### When I moved to Dubai,
I noticed all the Abaya brands Here are selling for what I feel like is an unrealistic price for one piece and it's not really promoting modesty. It becomes a luxury that people cannot access easily. I had a friend in Dubai come to me. She was like, I really want to wear Abayas but I wouldn't know where to start and it just doesn't feel accessible to me is not something I'd spend a lot of money on just to never wear and just thinking about all these things I feel like I could locally source them and my Abayas are made to order. I do not manufacture a whole bunch. Every piece is overseen and perfectly tailored to exactly what my customer would want.
